        <!-- A small description of what the portfolio is about -->
        <p>This portfolio page showcases the projects I completed throughout my User Design class this semester.
        It highlights my growth in design skills, including wireframing, prototyping, app redesigns, and user-centered thinking.
        Each project includes a brief description and visuals to show my design process and final results.
        This page serves as a collection of my work and a reflection of what I learned in the course.</p>
